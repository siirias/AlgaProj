An attemt for rough estimate of Algae development on given area.
ROUGH PLAN:

Will need as input at least:
	surface-layer currents for the period of forecast
	model fielsds for sun/wind/mixing
	in-situ/satellite measurements of current algae status

Pieces in this package will consist of:
	-part that combines available data on current biomass into gridded data
	-approximates how mixed the top layer/how much of the mass is visible on surface (based on wind history?)
	-Part that using currents information and calculated biomass, approximates movement and furture situation
	-part that approximates algae multiplication factor based on at least sun and temperature?
